    <ul>
      <li> Python </li>
      <li> Jupyter Notebook </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first part of this project is an exploratory analysis. The second part is an explanatory analysis that emphasizes a call to action.
      Parsed and cleaned a Ford GoBike System dataset to ensure data integrity. Renamed columns appropriately and ensured values follow their appropriate schema. Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover user demographic, ride duration, and ride distribution patterns.
      Provided actionable insights through compelling visualizations, potential reasons behind the findings, and strategic recommendations.

    <h3> Yelp Dataset Investigation </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python </li>
      <li> Jupyter Notebook </li>
      <li> Yelp API </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Utilized API calls to gather data from Yelp Fusion API. Resolved data quality and tidiness issues in the data obtained from the Yelp API and Yelpâ€™s open dataset. Combined data collected from both sources into one dataframe. Analyzed the integrated dataframe to identify relationships between variables, notably revealing a lack of correlation between review count and business rating.

    <h3> Class Project - Database Queries </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> SQL </li>
      <li> MySQL Workbench </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Created a database with an Author table, Client table, and a Book table. Populated the database with the information provided by the class' project prompt. I wrote 14 queries that retrieve various contents of the database. 
      Each query is followed by the result of that query. The file can be navigated through with the table of contents listed at the top of the file.
