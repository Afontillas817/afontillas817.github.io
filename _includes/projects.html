    <h3> Ford Bikeshare Capstone </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python </li>
      <li> Jupyter Notebook </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project consists of two components: The first is an analysis designed to uncover trends and relationships within the dataset to provide Ford with data-driven insights to help them adjust their approach, anticipate client needs, and meet demand more effectively. The second component is a report summarizing the key findings from the analysis. 
<br><br>
Parsed and cleaned a Ford GoBike System dataset to ensure data integrity. Renamed columns appropriately and ensured values conformed to the expected schema. Manipulated the data to evaluate various aspects of the data, including user characteristics, ride distribution by day, time, and station. Utilized contingency tables and a chi square test to analyze the observed and expected frequencies of station usage across different days. Concluded the project with actionable insights, supported by compelling visualizations, elaborations on findings, and strategic recommendations.

    <h3> Yelp Dataset Investigation </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python </li>
      <li> Yelp API </li>
      <li> Jupyter Notebook </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Utilized API calls to gather data from Yelp Fusion API. Resolved data quality and tidiness issues in the data obtained from the Yelp API and Yelpâ€™s open dataset. Combined data collected from both sources into one dataframe. Analyzed the integrated dataframe to identify relationships between variables, notably revealing a lack of correlation between user interaction and business rating.

    <h3> Class Project - Database Queries </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> SQL </li>
      <li> MySQL Workbench </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Created a database with an Author table, Client table, and a Book table. Populated the database with the information provided by the class' project prompt. I wrote 14 queries that retrieve various contents of the database. 
      Each query is followed by the result of that query. The file can be navigated through with the table of contents listed at the top of the file.
